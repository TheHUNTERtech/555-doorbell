A simple doorbell with two tones with the famous 555 timer.

It's an interesting circuit to learn the basics of the [555](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/555_timer_IC) and to learn how to solder and fabricate DIY a Through-Hole printed circuit board.

Also it's useful to learn the basics of EDA free-software [KiCad](http://kicad-pcb.org/).

This design was created to the [MakersUPV](https://makersupv.com) Workshop: [Taller fabricaci√≥n casera de circuitos impresos](https://github.com/makers-upv/taller-pcb) (in Spanish)
